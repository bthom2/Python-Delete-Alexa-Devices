"""
This script is used to interact with the Amazon Alexa API.

It contains four main functions: `get_entities`, `delete_entities`, `get_graphql_endpoints`, and `delete_endpoints`.

`get_entities` sends a GET request to the specified URL to retrieve entities related to the Amazon Alexa skill.
The response from the GET request is printed to the console and saved to a JSON file if it's not empty.

`delete_entities` sends a DELETE request to the specified URL to remove entities related to the Amazon Alexa skill.
The response from each DELETE request is printed to the console.

`get_graphql_endpoints` sends a POST request to the specified URL to retrieve specific properties of endpoints using a GraphQL query.
The response from the POST request is printed to the console and saved to a JSON file.

`delete_endpoints` sends a DELETE request to the specified URL to remove endpoints related to the Amazon Alexa skill.
The response from each DELETE request is printed to the console.

The script uses predefined headers and parameters for the requests, which are defined as global variables at the top of the script.

This script is intended to be run as a standalone file. When run, it first calls `get_entities` to retrieve the entities,
then calls `delete_entities` to delete them, then calls `get_graphql_endpoints` to retrieve the endpoints,
and finally calls `delete_endpoints` to delete them.
